## Description

Do you have a template written in HTML and want to convert it to Blade, to use in a Laravel project?
Then this package is for you. Its use is simple, and what you want is just the beginning to start your new Laravel project, from an HTML template.
After running the `php artisan template:build` command, you will have your files converted.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require lcloss/template --save-dev
```

## Usage

1. To convert your HTML files to Blade, start by creating the `/resources/views/templates/src` directory.
2. Copy your HTML files into the `/src` folder above.
3. If the template comes with `assets` directory, also copy the `assets` folder into `/src`.
4. Then, run the command:
```bash
php artisan template:build
```
5. The package will create the `/resources/views/templates/dist` folder with the converted files.
6. It will also create routes to view your template.

Open the browser at: http://seu-projeto.test/template
This route points to `index.blade.php`.

If there is another file as the root, such as `home.html`, then open the browser at:
http://seu-projeto.test/template/home

## Testing

No tests have been written, as it is only intended to convert files.
For a next version, I will probably add the folder configuration via `.env`, so you can create tests.
For now, we want something very simple.
