# Code of Conduct

Please note that this project is released with a Contributor Code of Conduct. By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.

1. Respect all contributors, regardless of their level of expertise, language, or culture.
2. Be friendly and patient.
3. Be welcoming: We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members of
4. Be considerate: Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making decisions.
5. Be respectful: Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It’s important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.
6. Be careful in the words that you choose: we are a community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants.
7. Be open: We invite anyone to participate in our project, regardless of their experience, knowledge, or background. We encourage everyone to learn, and we are willing to help anyone learn.
8. Be collaborative: We work together to achieve our goals. We prefer to get to the goal in the best way possible, and we are willing to change our ways to achieve that goal.
9. When you disagree, consult others: Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time and Laravel is no exception. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember that we’re different. The strength of Laravel comes from its varied community, people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.
10. Be pragmatic: We are a project that aims to be useful to its users. We are not a project that exists to implement the personal views of the developers. We are not a project that exists to make us feel good about ourselves. We are a project that exists to serve its users.
11. Step down considerately: Members of every project come and go and Laravel is no different. When you leave or disengage from the project, in whole or in part, we ask that you do so in a way that minimizes disruption to the project. This means you should tell people you are leaving and take the proper steps to ensure that others can pick up where you left off.
12. Be responsible for your actions: If you make a mistake, admit it. If someone asks for help, be helpful. If you are asked to take responsibility for a mistake, take responsibility for it. If you are unsure, ask for help. Nobody knows everything, and nobody is expected to be perfect in this community. Asking questions early avoids many problems later, so questions are encouraged, though they may be directed to the appropriate forum.
13. Be kind to others: Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren’t acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:
    - Violent threats or language directed against another person.
    - Discriminatory jokes and language.
    - Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
    - Posting (or threatening to post) other people’s personally identifying information (“doxing”).
    - Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.
    - Unwelcome sexual attention.
    - Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
    - Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.
    - When we disagree, try to understand why.
